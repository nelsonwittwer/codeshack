# Code Shack Baby Intro

I've been binging technical books of late. I found I was learning the
most when I would try to distill a chapter's concept down to a tweet or
two. I noticed a significant difference to my reading comprehension when
I did not follow this work flow. In an attempt to further focus my
studies and to build a nice beginer friendly reference, I came up with
the idea of publishing all of my learnin here.

For each concept I study, I'll make an entry here and tag it in a nice
fancy tag cloud. Each entry will composed of two parts, 1) a 140
charcter description of the topic and 2) a more detailed explanation
with code examples. 

I'm using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) as my content management
system. I know. Shock. Horror. Why not use a database backed platform?
In the future I may go that way, but I found it to be extreme overkill.
Middleman has great blog/tag features and will do everything I need. The
static nature of middleman means I don't have to worry about hosting an
expensive rails app, and I get to host on github pagese for free.

Another project for me. Wish me luck.

The [source for this
project](https://github.com/nelsonwittwer/codeshack) is hosted on
github. Take a look if you'd like to follow along.
